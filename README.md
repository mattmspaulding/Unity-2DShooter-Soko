## Notes on the Project
* I made this game and recorded the process to present for a design class
* The total development time was only 5 days, so there are ideas in the project that were left unfinished.
* The scope of the game was set small so I could actually finish it for the class. This project was a major learning experience and will help when I work on a new game, which hopefully will have better art and more ambitious features.

## Additional Assets 
* A* Pathfinding Project (https://arongranberg.com/astar/)
* Simple Vector Icons
* Virtual Joystick Pack
